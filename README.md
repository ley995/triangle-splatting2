This repo contains the official implementation for the paper "Triangle Splatting+: Differentiable Rendering with Opaque Triangles". 

We introduce **Triangle Splatting+**, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing.  
Our method surpasses prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to train. Moreover, the resulting meshes support downstream applications such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. 

ðŸ””The code will be released the 8th of October.ðŸ””

## Download optimized ply files (+-50MB)

If you want to run some scene on a game engine for yourself, you can download the Garden, Bicycle or Truck scenes from the following <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HMddW9_OMG2UCBWoJmspkoXBplf2PH5x">link</a>. To achieve the highest visual quality, you should use 4Ã— supersampling.


## Download the Unity project to explore physics-based interactions and walkable scenes
